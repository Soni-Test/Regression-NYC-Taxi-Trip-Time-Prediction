## Summary 
The dataset is based on the 2016 NYC Yellow Cab trip record data made available in Big Query on Google Cloud Platform. The data was originally published by the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC). The complete dataset consist of 1458644 & 11 rows and columns, consisting of different features. The major purpose of doing this project will help in predicting the average trip duration of passengers which will help them in saving their time from future trips as well as money, as it is well known for everyone the heavy traffic problem in New York City (NYC). Taxi agencies will also try to improve their service further as they are also getting tough competitions from app-based companies like lyft and uber.
